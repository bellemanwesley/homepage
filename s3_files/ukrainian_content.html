    		<h2>My Journey</h2>
    		<p>I started learning Ukrainian in June of 2017. Three years later and I still have a long way to go!</p>
        	<p>Available information technology and the internet have been invaluable to my journey learning Ukrainian. I want to share here some of my Ukrainian projects for anyone who might be interested as well as a way for me to document and organize my work.</p>
